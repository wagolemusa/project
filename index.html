	<h1>New Motherhood in the Age of Trump</h1>
	<p> October 2016, I found out I was pregnant. In November, I felt a thrill upon taking my unborn child into the booth with me to vote for the first female president of the United States.

After voting, I arranged the Hillary paraphernalia I’d collected over the years on the coffee table, like a kid at show-and-tell. I cooked black bean burgers for dinner, floating happily around the kitchen. My husband and I settled in on the sofa as if we were about to watch a favorite movie, one we’d seen a dozen times before. As the returns came in, he kept trying to make the math work: Okay, we lost Florida, but if Pennsylvania goes blue, there’s still a chance.</p>

	<h1>Why My Daughter’s Reaction to “13 Reasons Why” Broke My Heart</h1>
	<p>15-year-old daughter, while mature beyond her years, is like most other teenagers. She can be argumentative, with a sour disposition, often has her face buried in her phone, and, like most of her peers, loves a good Netflix series. Naturally, with all the hype surrounding Netflix’s “13 Reasons Why,” she jumped on the bandwagon last year and devoured the first season in a weekend while sequestered in her room.

Despite the show’s negative media attention and emails from her high school cautioning about allowing teens to watch the program, I did not prohibit her from seeing it. I appreciated the warnings and did heed the recommendation that I have a dialogue with her about the show because of its subject matter. I did not, however, take the advice to view it myself.</p>
